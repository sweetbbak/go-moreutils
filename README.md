Coreutils with a modern spin.
Why? Someone once said:
"If I cannot write it, then I do not understand it..."
and I took that to heart. This is purely for my entertainment and understanding of Unix systems,
if you want something battle tested, try: u-root, busybox, toybox, gnu coreutils or rust-coreutils.

## Examples

echo support HEX colors with the `-f` switch
```bash
  ./echo -f '{#1e1e1e}HELLO{#clr}'
```

printenv has colored output
```bash
  ./printenv -p
```
